_What’s a postural assessment?_ 
In a postural assessment, I look at your static posture to see if there are any imbalances that could cause or are causing pain and discomfort.

_Why does it work?_ No Pills. No Shakes. No Gimmicks. I believe in evidence-based programs that show results quickly. Whatever your goal is, you should start to see results within 12 weeks.

_Do I have to do a consultation before booking sessions?_ No, you don’t have to but it’s free and it’s useful to get a picture of where you want to get. Up to you. 

_Do I need to book a minimum number of hours?_ We’ll discuss in the consultation what makes most sense for your goals and your schedule. 

_What if I don’t reach my goals?_ If you’re not happy with the results you’re getting, you can stop the program at any point and you’ll get a full refund of all unused training hours.
