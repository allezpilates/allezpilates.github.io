Welcome! I'm a French-Moroccan clinical Pilates instructor based in Islington, London.

Since 2020, I've been dedicated to helping others lead active, injury-free lives, feeling stronger each day. My classes cater to all levels, offering a fun and challenging experience. You'll leave empowered and well-informed.

Previously, I worked in marketing, where a hectic lifestyle led to physical strains. Despite being active, I underestimated the impact of a weak core and poor posture on my back pain.

Pilates has transformed my approach to health, teaching me the importance of proper movement. My training is supportive and goal-oriented, designed to inspire and enhance your wellness journey. Let's start moving better together!
