Hi! 

I’m a French Moroccan fitness Instructor based in London, UK. Since 2016, I have honed a passion for helping others enjoy their lives to the fullest, be active, injury-free and feel stronger and healthier every day. 

I hold a Level 3 Diploma in teaching Mat Pilates and in TRX Suspension Training. I’m also certified in Principles of Exercise, Fitness and Health, as well as in Anatomy and Physiology for Exercise and Health. 

My joyful and enthusiastic nature make my classes challenging, varied and fun for beginners through to experienced students. I will motivate you to achieve your goals. 

If you want to see my teaching style firsthand, join my small group online classes. My warm and dynamic approach makes my classes accessible and engaging for everyone.
