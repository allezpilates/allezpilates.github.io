Hi! I’m a full time Pilates instructor based in Central London

Before I became a Pilates instructor, I worked in marketing for several international consultancies. My work and social life was hectic and took its toll on my body. Because I was very active, frequently running and biking, I didn’t think my back pain could be due to a weak core and I sustained bad posture as a result of my lack of postural awareness.

I was searching for a change and a friend suggested Pilates. I took part in a 30 Day Pilates challenge and loved it! After practicing Pilates for 3 months, I dropped from a dress size 14 to 10 and looked 2 inches taller from my improved posture! Looking better was just an added bonus. The real prize was when I realised that I had -unexpectedly- gotten rid of the long term chronic back pain that had been bothering me for years. At this point, I was hooked!

These changes motivated me to quit my job and go on various adventures. First, I freelanced as a tour guide and a behavioural design consultant for two years while traveling the world. I’ve completed several bike trips in Europe, discovered surfing and scuba-diving, and took part in several international swing dance camps. Then, in 2018, I joined an incredible startup called Makers where I helped career changers from various backgrounds become software engineers. This experience gave me the confidence to pursue my passion and go for a teacher training in Pilates in 2019. 

I now hold a Level 3 Diploma in teaching Mat Pilates. I’m also certified in Principles of Exercise, Fitness and Health, as well as Anatomy and Physiology for Exercise and Health. I trained with STOTT Pilates®, the gold standard in the discipline, to achieve my Mat and Reformer Pilates certification. 

I see Pilates as a life enabler. I would like to help people enjoy their lives to the fullest, be active, injury-free, and feel stronger and healthier everyday. 

I believe that my experience, passion, and overall enthusiastic nature make my classes challenging, varied, and fun. I’ve also been told that my lively personality has a motivational effect on individuals and my good communication skills work well with large groups.
