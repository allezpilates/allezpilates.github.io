Hi! 

I’m a French Moroccan fitness Instructor based in London, UK. Since 2016, I have honed a passion for helping others enjoy their lives to the fullest, be active, injury-free and feel stronger and healthier every day. 

I hold a Level 3 Diploma in teaching Mat Pilates and in TRX Suspension Training. I’m also certified in Principles of Exercise, Fitness and Health, as well as in Anatomy and Physiology for Exercise and Health. 

My joyful and enthusiastic nature make my classes challenging, varied and fun for beginners through to experienced students. I will motivate you to achieve your goals. 

If you want to see my teaching style firsthand, join my small group online classes. My warm and dynamic approach makes my classes accessible and engaging for everyone.


### Pilates group classes
Classes are on Wednesdays at 7pm and Saturdays at 9:30am and 11am
Pilates challenges your core stability, teaches you neutral alignment and connection to your breathing. The result is a balanced body that looks fit, feels revitalised and moves with ease.

### HIIT group sessions
Sessions are on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6pm.
The sessions start with a warm up to mobilise the joints and increase the heart rate followed up by HIIT circuits which will burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time and keep you in a high metabolic rate for hours.
