Hello, I’m Camelia. Like many, the first time I tried Pilates I was a bit sceptical, but a friend of mine kept raving about how it sorted out their back so I thought I’ll give it a month. Once I started practicing Pilates; the pain melted away with every session and I was inspired by the physical transformation so much so that I decided to quit my job and retrain with STOTT Pilates® to become a certified Pilates instructor. I have since gone on to pass the STOTT Pilates® Mat and Reformer Intensive course and I am also working on attaining an injury recovery specialisation.

I would love to hear your story and find a way to help you.
