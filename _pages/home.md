Everybody is different and wants to achieve different goals, that's why I believe working 1:1 means getting a program matching your unique needs and abilities. 

Together, we create a goal-oriented program and agree on the metrics we want to track and we will review your progress every 8 to 12 weeks. 

The first step is to have a chat to cover your physical condition, current and past injuries and goals so we can establish if and how we can help you.

# FAQ: 

_How much does it cost?_
- Initial consultation : free
- Online Private Session : £48
- Class Recording : £8
- Face To Face Private Session : £60

_What’s a postural assessment?_ 
In a postural assessment, I look at your static posture to see if there are any imbalances that could cause or are causing pain and discomfort.

_Why does it work?_ No Pills. No Shakes. No Gimmicks. I believe in evidence-based programs that show results quickly. Whatever your goal is, you should start to see results within 12 weeks.

_Do I have to do a consultation before booking sessions?_ No, you don’t have to but it’s free and it’s useful to get a picture of where you want to get. Up to you. 

_Do I need to book a minimum number of hours?_ We’ll discuss in the consultation what makes most sense for your goals and your schedule. 

_What if I don’t reach my goals?_ If you’re not happy with the results you’re getting, you can stop the program at any point and you’ll get a full refund of all unused training hours.
