Hi, 

Everybody is different and wants to achieve different goals, that's why we believe working 1:1 means getting a program matching your unique needs and abilities. 

Here are some recent examples of clients we worked with:
 
> Mikhail: unhappy with his posture (forward head, rounding of the shoulders, slumping of the upper back and pelvic tilt). We did a postural assessment and worked once a week in private session and twice a week in group classes. We kept track of his posture improvements with regular postural assessments.

> Yassir: wants to build up core strength to prevent injuries in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. We did a fitness assessment and worked on bi-weekly core endurance training mixing HIIT, TRX and Pilates practice. We used a set of exercises to keep track of his improvements.

> Siham: wants to build strength and mobility during her pregnancy. We did prenatal Pilates once a week and we gave her daily exercises to do on her own to strengthen her deep core muscles and pelvic floor and also we worked on upper body strength to prepare for the demand on the body when carrying a baby several hours a day.  

> Cecile: wants to stay active during the lockdown. We had Pilates twice a week, one in a group class setting and one 1:1 to focus on technique.

Together, we create a goal-oriented program and agree on the metrics we want to track. You will get access to a dashboard to keep track of your progress. 

The first step is to have a chat to cover your physical condition, current and past injuries and goals so we can establish if and how we can help you.

_How much does it cost?_

_What’s a postural assessment?_ 
In a postural assessment, we look at your static posture to see if there are any imbalances that could cause or are causing pain and discomfort.

_Why does it work?_ No Pills. No Shakes. No Gimmicks. We believe in evidence-based programs that show results quickly. Whatever your goal is, you should start to see results within 12 weeks.

_Do I have to do a consultation before booking sessions?_ No, you don’t have to but it’s free and it’s useful to get a picture of where you want to get. Up to you. 

_Do I need to book a minimum number of hours?_ We’ll discuss in the consultation what makes most sense for your goals and your schedule. 

_What if I don’t reach my goals?_ If you’re not happy with the results you’re getting, you can stop the program at any point and you’ll get a full refund of all unused training hours.
