Everybody is different and wants to achieve different goals, that's why I believe working 1:1 means getting a program matching your unique needs and abilities. 

Together, we create a goal-oriented program and agree on the metrics we want to track and we will review your progress every 8 to 12 weeks. 

The first step is to have a chat to cover your physical condition, current and past injuries and goals so we can establish if and how we can help you.
